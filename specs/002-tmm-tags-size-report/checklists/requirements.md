# Specification Quality Checklist: TMM Tags, Size, and Report

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Technology constraints supplied in the input (CSS class names, JS function names, enum literal types) are intentionally excluded from the spec; they are recorded for the plan phase.
- SC-006.1 through SC-008.3 are directly traceable to named Acceptance Scenarios in the spec.
- The `category` → `tags` replacement is confirmed as clean (no migration) per the business statement and assumptions.
